        <h2>Algebraic Expression & Identities, Factorization</h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            Algebraic Expression is a Combination of integers, variables and operations. 
Ex - 2(x + 8y).
The main point of these expression is that they don't equate to anything.
Now though you can't solve expression because it does'nt equate to anything but still you can very much simplify them.
One such way is by Highest Common Factior or HCF.
<br><br>
Remove the highest common factor from an algebraic statement and position it in front of the brackets to factorise it.
After that, divide each term by the highest common factor to get the phrase inside the brackets.
<br>
Ex- 7x+35
=> 7x=7*x
=> 35=7*5
 Common factor=7
Thus, the simplified equation is 7(x+5).
<br><br>
Now the 2nd way is using Algebraic Identities:
<br><br>
There are multiple identities which we can use to simplify them but I will show only three Identities and also show an example.
<br>
=>(a + b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab +b<sup>2</sup>,
=>(a - b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup>
=>a<sup>2</sup> – b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)(a – b)
<br>
Now these are a few of those identities which are used to calculate Algebraic Expressions.
<br>
Ex-z<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup> + 9
<br>
We can express z<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>z</sup> + 9 as using a<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)<sup>2</sup>

= (z)<sup>2</sup>  + 2(z)(3) + (3)<sup>2</sup>
<br>
= (z + 3)<sup>2</sup>
<br>
= (z + 3)(z + 3)         (Source: math-only-math.com)
<br><br>
Now for the 3rd way of factorizing.
<br><br>
Note: This is applicable only on Trinomials.
<br><br>
This method is called the Sum and Product Factorizing. This method is used to solve Quadratic Equations.
This method is based on this expression (ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c) with the value of a=1. This method is also used the most.
<br><br>
Ex-x<sup>2</sup>+7x+12
<br><br>
The product is equal to the "A" value multiplied by the "C" value. The sum is the b value in this example. In this situation, 7.
Find the two integers that add up to 12 (the product) and multiply them by 7. (the sum). +4 and +3 points
<br><br>
These are the two elements that you must consider. Put the x in the front and the factors in the back of your two binomials. (x+4)(x+3)
<br><br>
This is the factored expression.        (Source: www.akronschools.org)
<br><br>
How to calculate the root of a Linear Equation?
Simple way of finding the root of a linear equation with one variable is to ship all the constants to the RHS or Right-Hand-Side,
then since the sides are changing the operations will change as well and then perform the operation and
you find the root of the equation which is the value of the variable.
<br><br>
Ex- x+4=7.
<br><br>
=>x = 7-4
=>x = 3
<br><br>
This is also a solution to solve a formed linear equation. Now the question arises how do you form a linear equation? Well make sure that the equation you form is
in the slope-intercept form of y = mx+b in which x and y are variable.

        <h2>Area of Polygons</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are different formulas to calculate the area based on the fact whether it is regular or an irregular polygon.
<br><br>
 A regular polygon's area is half of the product of its apothem and perimeter. The formula is usually expressed as Area=1/2(ap), where a denotes the apothem's length and p represents the perimeter.A regular polygon's area is half of the product of its apothem and perimeter. The formula is usually expressed as Area=1/2(ap), where a denotes the apothem's length and p represents the perimeter.A regular polygon's area is half of the product of its apothem and perimeter.

The formula is usually expressed as Area=1/2(ap), where a denotes the apothem's length and p represents the perimeter.
<br><br>
Irregular Polygon Area: This is a bit more complicated. First thing to do is to seperate them to regular polygon and 
then calculate the area and then finally, add both of them together.

        Cube, Cube and Cuboid.</p>
