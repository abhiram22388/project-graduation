        <br></br>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">As per new research, increasing temperatures may reduce the efficiency of food chains,
            putting the survival of larger animals in danger. Rising temperatures raise the physiological
            cost of growth, resulting in less efficient power flow through the food supply chain 
            and, as a result, a drop in total biomass.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The carbon cycle describes the movement of carbon atoms from the atmosphere and back into the atmosphere. 
                            When organisms die, volcanic eruption happens, flames burn, oil and coal are burned, and 
                            a variety of other processes release carbon into the atmosphere. The four steps of Carbon cycle
                            are Photosynthesis, Decomposition, Respiration and Combustion.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The water cycle illustrates the continuous flow of water on Earth and even in the atmosphere. 
                            It's a complex process with many different processes. Fluid water evaporates into water vapour, 
                            condenses into clouds, and precipitates as rain and snow on the ground.
                            The seven steps of water cycle are :evaporation, condensation, precipitation, interception, 
                            infiltration, percolation, transpiration, runoff, and storage.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The nitrogen cycle is a biogeochemical cycle in which nitrogen is converted into multiple 
                            chemical forms as it passes through the atmospheric, land, and sea ecosystems. Fixation, 
                            ammonification, nitrification, and denitrification are all crucial components in the nitrogen cycle.</p>

                        <p>Phosphorus passes through stones, water, soil, sediments, and creatures in a loop. 
                            Rainfall and weathering cause phosphate ions and other ions to be released from stones throughout 
                            time. When a plant or animal dies, it decomposes, discharging organic phosphate into the soil..</p>

                                The process of converting glucose into energy in the form of ATP is known as cellular respiration. 
                                Glucose must be processed into a form that the mitochondrion can use before cellular respiration can begin.</p>

                        <p>Photosynthesis is a process by which carbon dioxide and water are converted into oxygen and glucose. 
                            The plant consumes glucose as food, and oxygen is produced as a by-product. During cellular 
                            respiration, oxygen and glucose are converted to water and carbon dioxide.</p>

                            a hydrogen ion. Acid tastes sour. Bases have a bitter taste.
                            There are a few acids and bases in our own body.

                    <h2>Diffusion</h2>
                    <p>Diffusion is a process that results in a net flow of substance from a high-concentration zone to a low-concentration zone due to the unexpected mobility of molecules. The concentration gradient is discovered to be proportional to the diffusing substance's rate of flow.</p>

                    <p>Osmosis is defined as the spontaneous net movement or diffusion of solvent molecules through a selectively permeable membrane from a high water potential to a low water potential in a direction that tends to equalise the solute concentrations on both sides.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The weak force works only across distances shorter than that of the atomic nucleus, 
            but the electromagnetic force can extend over great distances (as shown 
            in the light of stars extending across entire galaxies), weakening only as 
            the distance square increases. It is one of the 4 fundamental forces in the universe.</p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 2.5em; color: white;">why are metals good conductors of electricity and non metals are not?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>The valence electrons in metal atoms are loosely bound by the nucleus and are movable. 
            As a result, metals are excellent electrical conductors. The valence electrons 
            of non-metal atoms are bound more strongly by the nucleus and are not movable.
            So there is no chance of electricity to pass through, therefore Metals are good conductors and
            non-metals are not. </p>

            <h2>Electrolyte</h2>
            <p>The breakdown of a substance into positively and negatively charged particles called ions,
                which migrate toward and are discharged at the negative and positive terminals (cathode 
                and anode) of an electric circuit, respectively, transmits electric current.
                Strong electrolytes are chemical substance that conduct electricity when dissolved in water.
                A weak electrolyte is one that ionises in solution very little.</p>

        <div class="continent">
            <h2>Conductors</h2>
            <p>Conductors are materials that enable electrons to freely flow through one 
                particle to the next. Charge is applied through the free movement 
                of electrons in conductors. Since metal's valence electron is
                not tightly bound by the nucleus and is moveable. So nearly all metals
                are good conductors.

            <h2>Insulator</h2>
            <p>Quite the opposite of conductors, An insulator is a material that prevents
                energy from easily moving through it, such as electricity, heat, or cold.
                Plastic and wood are a few examples of insulator.</p>

            <h2>Ohm's Law</h2>
            <p>The flow through a conductor is proportional to the applied voltage 
                from across conductor, as according Ohm's law. Since V is the 
                voltage from across conductor & I is the current flowing through 
                it, the formula is V=IR.Ohm's law is important for describing 
                electric circuits since it links the voltage and current, with 
                the resistance value moderating the relationship.</p>

                        air are certainly longitudinal waves. The particles of air do not vibrate 
                        in a transverse manner as sound travels through air (or any other fluid medium).</p>

                        high amplitudes are referred to as sonic. Many animals can hear noises in 
                        the ultrasonic frequency range that humans can hear. </p>
