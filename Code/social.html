            <h2>Indian Constitution</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The Indian Constitution is the country's supreme law. The constitution establishes a framework
                that defines the fundamental political code, structure, procedures, powers, and responsibilities
                of government institutions, as well as people' fundamental rights, directive principles, and responsibilities.
                It also is the longest constitution in the world containing 449 articles in 25 parts, 12 schedules, 5 appendices and 104 Amendments.
                It decides what is right and what is wrong. Without the constitution there wouldn't be fair judgement.
                A democratic country needs a constitution because It provides useful information about the government's structure, organs, tasks, and responsibilities.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Wind turbines are designed to convert wind currents into power. 
                    The magnets are moved around the copper plates as the blades of the turbine are rotated by the wind.
                    This causes electrons to flow through them. Wind farms are more likely to be on the ocean because there
                    is more wind in the ocean region. Ex- North Sea, one of the largest wind farms in Europe powering 
                    nearly 300,000 households.</p>

                            growing economy-wise. One way to increase it's growth is by actually instead of saving, we should

                                Since every action is on a global scale so there might be forced migration.</p>

                <h1 style="color: #fff; font-size: 2em;">Agriculture and Civilizations</h1>
                <br><br>
                <p>When people first started pursuing agriculture about ten thousand years ago, not only did their lives change,
                but the Earth's landscape did as well. Humans were no longer compelled to walk around in quest of meat. 
                They could settle down in one location and produce more food than they need, leading in an increase in 
                human population. Humans also made more deliberate changes to the Earth's surface in order 
                to increase the amount of land available for cultivation.Humans made the land more suitable for 
                growing crops by cutting down trees and digging irrigation canals, to give some examples. Agriculture 
                is the seventh major threshold of increasing complexity in this course because it resulted in such 
                dramatic changes in the Earth and the way humans lived. Scientists and historians, as well as the rest of 
                us, are still discovering more about the origins of agriculture and the implications of this evolution for our species.
                This now is proving that farming is much better than foraging both for humans as well as the land and animals
                <br><br>
                <h2>Civilizations</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Humans were able to build permanent communities and quit their wandering lifestyles because of farming.
                Humans transitioned from hunting and gathering to permanent farming settlements. Urban areas arose
                as populations grew in response to the greater food surplus. The abundance of food also resulted in the 
                emergence of civilization. Since agriculture not only increase the supply of food but it also increased
                the supply of raw material so it helped in people making larger structures more easily and that is how
                a lot of the built-up areas came into existence but still agriculture was not the sole cause of civilizations
                existing. People also used materials such as wool and leather from animals but still a lot of the credit 
                should go to agriculture.</p>

    common by all humans evolved over a six-million-year period from apelike ancestors.</p>
